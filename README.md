# 📊 Content Personalization System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores how **user behavior data** can be analyzed to design a **content personalization system** similar to YouTube’s recommendation engine. The focus is on **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and evaluation of recommendation patterns**, showing how structured insights can improve user engagement.

Instead of only highlighting algorithms, this project demonstrates the **data analysis process** behind building recommendation systems.

## 🔄 Data Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Cleaning and formatting user–video interaction data
   * Handling missing values and sparsity in the dataset
   * Feature engineering for user activity and video metadata

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Distribution of user activity levels (active vs. casual users)
   * Most popular content categories
   * Long-tail effect: analyzing niche vs. trending content
   * Correlation between user engagement and content attributes

3. **Recommendation Insights**

   * Collaborative Filtering → Finds users with similar behavior
   * Content-Based Filtering → Leverages video attributes for similarity
   * Hybrid Analysis → Combines behavioral and content features

4. **Evaluation**

   * Precision@K & Recall@K to assess relevance of recommendations
   * Coverage and diversity of recommendations
   * Visualization of recommendation distribution across users/items

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **Data KPIs**

  * Number of users, items, and interactions analyzed
  * Activity distribution (how many users consume most content)
  * Popular vs. niche content breakdown

* **Recommendation KPIs**

  * Precision@K → % of recommended items that were relevant
  * Recall@K → % of relevant items captured in recommendations
  * Coverage → % of catalog that can be recommended
  * Diversity → Spread of recommendations beyond most popular items

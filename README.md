# 📊 Content Personalization System

📌 **Project Overview**

This project explores how **user behavior data** can be analyzed to design a **content personalization system** similar to YouTube’s recommendation engine. The focus is on **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and evaluation of recommendation patterns**, showing how structured insights can improve user engagement.

Instead of only highlighting algorithms, this project emphasizes the **data analysis process** behind building recommendation systems.

## 🔄 Data Analysis Workflow

### **1. Data Preprocessing**

* Cleaning and formatting user–video interaction data
* Handling missing values and sparsity in the dataset
* Feature engineering for user activity and video metadata

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Distribution of user activity levels (active vs. casual users)
* Identifying most popular content categories
* Analyzing the *long-tail effect* (niche vs. trending content)
* Correlation between user engagement and content attributes

### **3. Recommendation Insights**

* **Collaborative Filtering** → Finds users with similar behavior
* **Content-Based Filtering** → Leverages video attributes for similarity
* **Hybrid Analysis** → Combines behavioral and content features

### **4. Evaluation**

* Precision@K & Recall@K → measure recommendation relevance
* Coverage & diversity → assess system’s ability to suggest across the catalog
* Visualization of recommendation distribution across users/items

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### **Data KPIs**

* Number of users, items, and interactions analyzed
* Activity distribution (how many users consume most content)
* Popular vs. niche content breakdown

### **Recommendation KPIs**

* **Precision@K** → % of recommended items that were relevant
* **Recall@K** → % of relevant items captured in recommendations
* **Coverage** → % of catalog that can be recommended
* **Diversity** → Spread of recommendations beyond most popular items
